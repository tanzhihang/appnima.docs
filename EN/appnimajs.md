App/nima.JS
===========
Find out how to add soul to your apps with first LaaS in the world.

*Current version: [1.0.0]()*

To have appnima.js ready to work with you only have to set the value of the variable `Appnima.key` with the key that APP/NIMA provides you on the application creation:

    Appnima.key = "YOUR_KEY";

App/nima store user's session data in memory, so the session will persist in time.


Promises
--------
Appnima.js uses the promise pattern to handle each request, so to attach a callback (with error and result) to each request we have to do it using `.then` as it is shown in the following example:

    Appnima.resource().then(function(error, result){
        if(error !== null){
            console.log("Error", error);
        }else{
            console.log("Success", result);
        }
    });


Error Handler
-------------
Appnima.js has the capability to centralize the error management in a method. To use this, just assign to Appnima.onError a callback function that will receive the generated error:

    Appnima.onError = function(error){
        console.log("CODE: ", error.code);
        console.log("TYPE: ", error.type);
        console.log("MESSAGE: ", error.message);
    };

Token Management
----------------
App/nima uses a token to access the resources. When a token is expired the server will return a `480` error code, to refresh the token the method `Appnima.User.token()` must be called. It will do all the necessary transactions to update your token so you can continue working.

User
====
Basic
-----
#### Signup
To register a user in your application you only need to call the following method using as parameters the email, password and optionally a username:

    Appnima.User.signup ("javi@tapquo.com", "USER_PASSWORD");


#### Login
Login a user is as easy as calling the resource with the email and password:

    Appnima.User.login("javi@tapquo.com", "USER_PASSWORD");


#### Logout
If you want to logout a user of your application as simple as calling the method *logout* without any parameter:

    Appnima.User.logout();


#### Information
Do you need all the data registered by a user? Just call this resource to get information:

    Appnima.User.info();

In addition, to obtain information of any user of App/nima, you only have to send the id of this user to the previous method:

    Appnima.User.info(1244545632);


The object you will receive in both cases is:

```json
    {
        _id:            28319319832
        mail:           "javi@tapquo.com",
        username:       "soyjavi",
        name:           "Javi Jimenez",
        avatar:         "http://USER_AVATAR_URL",
        bio:            "Founder & CTO at @tapquo",
        phone:          "PHONE_NUMBER",
        token:          "USER_TOKEN",
        refresh_token:  "REFRESH_TOKEN"
    }
```


#### Update
The `update` resource also allows users to update their data. To do this just call it using as parameter a dictionary that contains all this optional fields:

    data = {
        mail: "inigo@tapquo.com",
        username: "haas85",
        name: "Inigo",
        avatar: "http://AVATAR_URL",
        picture: "http://PICTURE_URL",
        phone: "29306832906",
        site: "http://tapquo.com",
        bio: ""
    }

    Appnima.User.update(data);


#### Avatar
Your users can upload their own avatar file. To upload an avatar use this resource using as parameter the avatar coded in Base64:

    Appnima.User.avatar(USER_AVATAR);

Password
--------
APP/NIMA offers its users two ways to deal passwords, remember it or change it.

#### Remember password
Esta acción se realiza mediante dos funciones. Primero habría que llamar al siguiente método:

    Appnima.User.rememberPassword("jdkdksj421432k", "http://application_domain", "reset_password");

The first parameter is the user ```token``` of APP/NIMA, that is, the user ```access_token```. The second parameter is the domain of the application that calls this function and the latter parameter the url that you want to call.

This function sends a mail to the user who owns the token from APP/NIMA with a URL as follows:

    DOMINIO/URL/CODE -> http://application_domain/reset_password/25kj4fkwnfmndjkhgjk4h5nmf

The code is generated by APP/NIMA and serves to identify which user request asked to remember the password. For this, as you can see, it is necessary to generate an endpoint in the backend of the application with this URL where there is a form where you fill in the desired new password. So you have to call the following method:

    Appnima.User.resetPassword("25kj4fkwnfmndjkhgjk4h5nmf", "12345");

The first parameter is the URL code generated in the previous step and the second parameter is the new password that the user wants to regenerate. Once done, APP/NIMA sends an email telling user that the password has been changed.

In the case of not having application backend, APP/NIMA offers a view to regenerate the password to the user. This method should be called:

    Appnima.User.rememberPassword("fdfadsfdsf");

Passing only the user's token you want to regenerate the password and APP/NIMA will send you an email with the URL where regenerating own password.

#### Change password
With this feature you can change your password directly. The only requirement is that the user is logged in with APP/NIMA, and then have to call the following method:

    Appnima.User.changePassword("12345", "67890");

The first parameter is the old password and the second is the new password.

Terminal
--------

#### Register or Update
With this resource you can register or update the device the user is using to access the application. The request is done in the following way:

    Appnima.User.terminal("Android", "Phone", "MobilePhone", "4.1");

#### Info
Get the terminals that the user has used to access to the application using this resource:

    Appnima.User.teminal();

The data you will receive will be like:

```json
    [{
        _id:        "5719721071057"
        type:       "phone",
        os:         "ios",
        token:      "OHSAF9075HFQ",
        version:    "6.0"
    },
    {
        _id:        "57592807235"
        type:       "desktop",
        os:         "macos",
        token:      "89YWEOFOGH022GB",
        version:    "10.8"
    }]
```


Subscription
------------
If you need it, you can ask users to register their emails to get an invitation to the app. Just call the resource using the email as parameter:

    Appnima.User.subscribe("javi@tapquo.com");


Tickets
-------
Use this resource as ticket managing system to resolve incidences or attend consults from users. The request requires an object as follows:

```json
    parameters = {
        title       : "[QUESTION]: How can I do this?",
        description : "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit",
        reference   : "1356f43524fa4",
        type        : "2"
    }
```

The reference field is used if you want to add the ID of any other model, either APPNIMA or another database .
The type field can be 0, 1 or 2. If this field is not sent, the default is 0 .

0 - > "question"
1 - > " bug"
3 -> "support"

    Appnima.User.ticket(parameters);
    
On the other hand, if you modify a ticket you have two options :

The first would be to change the ticket. This is only possible when the ticket is not responded . To do this you just have to send the same data to create when adding the ID of the ticket to be modified .

The other option is to answer a ticket. This would have to send the following criteria:

```json
    parameters = {
        response : "Lorem ipsum"
    }
```

Once replied to ticket, an email is sent to the creator of that ticket.
In both cases you have to send the data to the following call:

    Appnima.User.updateTicket(parameters);

If you want to get a ticket in particular, would have to send the ID of the ticket to the next call of AppnimaJS :

    ``` json
        parameters = {id: 325425324563654654 }
    ```

    Appnima.User.getTicket(parameters);

There is also the option of finding a set of tickets. This would send the following parameters:

    ``` json
        parameters = {
            reference: 325425324563654654,
            type: 0,
            solved : true,
            user: 43242465344789
        }
    ```

The above example would be the option to send all possible parameters . The `solved` attribute can be `true` or `false` o can not be shipped. If sent like `true`, you would like answered tickets. If you send like `false` you would like tickets that not answered, and if that attribute is not sent it is because you want to get any ticket, whether answered or not. Any of the attributes of the object could not be sent.

This call needs to be done to find the tickets would be:

    Appnima.User.searchTickets(parameters);

You can use pagination sended this parameters:

    ``` json
        parameters = {
            reference: 325425324563654654,
            type: 0,
            solved : true,
            user: 43242465344789,
            num_results: 10,
            page: 1
        }
    ```
Is the same method like in post pagination but there not send "last_data" attribute.

Relathionships
==============

#### Search
Find people on your application. Sends any string for mail or username attribute to search:

    Appnima.Network.search("javi");

The server returns `200 Ok` and the list that contains the query:

```json
    [{
        avatar      : "http://appnima.com/img/avatar.jpg"
        id          : "59f34ac11a7e121b112b431f"
        name        : "javi"
        username    : "javi@javi.com"
    },
    {
        avatar      : "http://appnima.com/img/avatar.jpg"
        id          : "59f34ac11a7e121b112b431e"
        name        : "javier"
        username    : "a3@appnima.com"
    },
    {
        avatar      : "http://appnima.com/img/avatar.jpg"
        id          : "59f34ac11a7e121b112b431d"
        name        : null
        username    : "j.villar@javi.com"
    }]
```

#### Follow
You can follow a user using this resource, call this resource using the user to follow's id as parameter:

    Appnima.Network.follow("23094392049024112b431d");


#### Unfollow
You can unfollow a user using this resource, call this resource using the user to unfollow's id as parameter:

    Appnima.Network.unfollow("23094392049024112b431d");


#### Following
With this resource you can get the list of people that a user is following. It works as the previous parameter, accepting an optional user id parameter:

    Appnima.Network.following();

    Appnima.Network.following({user: "23094392049024112b431d"});

On the other hand, there is also the option for you to return the list with pagination, that is, that in each API call returning part of the list of users. This should be sent only two variables along with the user id:

    parameters =
        user: "23094392049024112b431d"
        page: 0
        num_results: 5

    Appnima.Network.following(parameters);

The first variable is the page number you want to obtain, that is, the part of the list you want to get. Second number is the number of results you want to obtain. In the first call, this variable will be multiplied by 2, and in other cases, this variable is the same.

#### Followers
With this resource you can get the list of people that follow a user. It works as the previous parameter, accepting an optional user id parameter:

    Appnima.Network.followers();

    Appnima.Network.followers({user: "23094392049024112b431d"});

Like as explained above, it is also possible to obtain results with pagination. The mode of this is the same as getting the users you follow.

In this case, the call returns one more variable in each object. This variable indicate that user is loggued is follow or not that user.

#### Friends
You can also obtain the session's friends, a friend is considered the user having a reinforced relationship (follower / following)

    Appnima.Network.friends();

        id      : "52f34ac66a7e665b222b6617"
        mail    : "jany@jany.com"
        name    : "jany"
        username: "janixy91"
    }]
```


#### Check
With this resource yoa can get information about logged user's realtionship with other user, if I am following him and if he is my follower:

    Appnima.Network.check("52f34ac66a7e665b222b6617");

The server returns `200 Ok` and the next object:

```json
    {
        following:  true,
        follower:   false
    }
```

Posts
--------
#### Create
Users can create posts within an application. For this they have to send the following object with wants parameters with the request:

    parameters =
      title   : "Lorem Ipsum",
      content : "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.",
      image   : "http://IMAGE_URL"

    Appnima.Network.Post.create(parameters);

Only ```content``` parameter is required. An example of how to create a ```post``` with only content is the following.

    Appnima.Network.Post.create({content: "Lorem Ipsum"});

This call will return an object with information on the new post:

    post = {
        id         : 4234325425234,
        content    : "Lorem Ipsum",
        image      : "http://IMAGE_URL",
        owner      : {
            id       : 423423432423,
            name     : user1,
            username : username1,
            avatar   : http://AVATAR_URL
        },
        comments   : [],
        likes      : [],
        is_liked   : false,
        created_at : POST_CREATED_DATA
    }

#### Update
The user can update created post. To do this, user must send the following parameters:

    parameters =
        id      : "124523132",
        content : "Lorem Ipsum update content",
        title   : "Lorem Ipsum update title",
        image   : "http://IMAGE_URL"

    Appnima.Network.Post.update(parameters);

Not required to send the data that will not be modified. Two examples of this would be:

    parameters =
        id      : "123456",
        content : "Lorem Ipsum 2",
        image   : "http://IMAGE_URL2"

    Appnima.Network.Post.update(parameters);

    parameters =
        id      : "123456",
        content : "Lorem Ipsum 1",
        title   : "Lorem ipsum 2"
    Appnima.Network.Post.update(parameters);

As can be seen, in the first case, you want to change the content and the image but not the title, so you must send that field to null.

In the second case, you want to change the content and the title and image as the last parameter is not necessary to pass null. The same would happen in the following case:

    parameters =
        id      : "121131331",
        content : "Lorem ipsum new"

    Appnima.Network.Post.update(parameters);

In this case you only want to modify the content and therefore, other variables that go behind would not need to send in null.

This method returns ```message:" Successful "``` if all went well.

#### Delete
The user can delete created post.
El usuario que ha creado un post puede borrarlo. To do this only has to send the id of the post to be deleted:

    Appnima.Network.Post.remove("124523132");

As in the previous method, if all went well return a message ```message: "Successful"```

#### Get a post
The user can get the information of a concrete post sending ```id``` of that post.


    Appnima.Network.Post.get("124523132");

This call return following data:

    post = {
        id         : 4234325425234,
        content    : "Lorem Ipsum",
        image      : "http://IMAGE_URL",
        owner      : {
            id       : 423423432423,
            name     : user1,
            username : username1,
            avatar   : http://AVATAR_URL
        },
        comments   : [
                {
                    id: 4324234,
                    content: "Comment 1",
                    created_at: comment_created_data,
                    owner: {
                        avatar: http://AVATAR_URL,
                        id: 3425425425,
                        name: user,
                        username: username
                    }
                }
            ],
        likes      : [
            {
                avatar: http://AVATAR_URL,
                id: 3425425425,
                name: user,
                username: username
            },
            {
                avatar: http://AVATAR_URL,
                id: 86765545678,
                name: user1,
                username: username1
            },
        ],
        is_liked   : false,
        created_at : POST_CREATED_DATA
    }

The list of likes are users who have made like this post.

#### Search
The user can search for a particular post by the text of its content, or if it sends just a word, it will return all posts that contain that word in their content.

    parameters =
        query       : "lorem",
        page        : 1,
        num_results : 12,
        last_data   : last_data

    Appnima.Network.Post.search(parameters);

As can be seen, in this case the results are to be obtained by pagination, as explained above. But if it does not wish to use it, you simply have to make the call as follows:

    Appnima.Network.Post.search({query: "Lorem"});

In this case, both methods return an array of the post has been found, or an empty array if none match.

#### Counter
This method is used to obtain the counter of post that user created. The answer is ```posts_count:8 ```. In this example, the user of the session would have created eight post.

    Appnima.Network.Post.counter();
    Appnima.Network.Post.counter("424234234324");

If user sends an user id, method return counter of that user.

#### Timeline
This method is used to obtain a list of post. There would be two different ways of creating two different results. A case would be:

    parameters =
        page        : page,
        num_results : 12,
        last_data   : last_data

    Appnima.Network.Post.timeline();
    Appnima.Network.Post.timeline(parameters);

In this case, the first call would get the ```timeline``` of session user. This is a list of post that user created and those who user follow. (Easy example to understand is the timeline of ```Twitter```).

In second call is the same, only to be get posts by pagination.
The other case would be:

    Appnima.Network.Post.timeline({username: "my_username"});

    parameters =
        username    : "my_username",
        page        : 1,
        num_results : 12,
        last_data   : last_data
    Appnima.Network.Post.timeline(username, page, num_results, last_data);

In this case you are getting the timeline of a specific user, the post he has written. (Next to the example of Twitter, this case would be when you enter in to the profile of a particular user). As you can see, you can also do by pagination.

#### Create comment
Posts may have comments, and with this call user can do comments.

    parameters =
        id      : "424231423423",
        content : "Este es mi comentario"

    Appnima.Network.Post.createComment(parameters);

Call returns ```message: "Successful"```.

#### Delete comment
The user who created a comment can delete his comments with following method sending comment ```id```:

    Appnima.Network.Post.deleteComment("4234324234234");

Call returns ```message: "Successful"```.

#### Get comment
To obtain all comments of post the user may to call this method sending ```id```of post:

    Appnima.Network.Post.comments("424231423423");

This call return following array of objects:

    comments   : [
                {
                    id: 4324234,
                    content: "Comment 1",

    Appnima.Network.Post.userLike(parameters);

Location
========
Places
------
#### Search
Using the users latitude and longitude or any point you can get the nearest places such as museums, restaurants, public buildings… You also can provide a search radius to get a more accurate search. To do this use this respource  with the latitude, longitude and radius:

    Appnima.Location.places("43.6525842", "-79.3834173, 100");


#### Info
Get detailed information from a place using this resource. Send the `ID` and `REFERENCE` with the request:

    Appnima.Location.place("28319319833", "CqQBlwAAAEXdx350jL2InIRtksTkbZJ-m");


#### Add
In APP/NIMA you can add a place and add relevant information such as name, address, phone number… To do this yo have to use this resource with the following parameters: Name, address, locality, Postal Code, Country, latitude and longitude:

    Appnima.Location.add("Talleres Juan", "C/ Laubide 10", "Mungia", "48100", "ES", "43.354", "-2.8467");

Optionally you can add email, phone and web site data.


#### Checkins
You users can register the places where they are. Send the `ID` and `REFERENCE` with the request:

    Appnima.Location.checkin("28319319833", "CqQBlwAAAEXdx350jL2InIRtksTkbZJ-m");

You can get the list of checkins with this resource. The unique parameter needed is the user's id:

    Appnima.Location.checkins("28319319833");


People
------
#### Friends around
You can ask APP/NIMA for the friends that are near to you. The parameters needed are the latitude, longitude and radius:

    Appnima.Location.friends("43.6525842", "-79.3834173, 100");


#### People around

Socket
======
Groups
------
The groups are persistent rooms from 1 to N users. In the groups only allowed users can connect and send data. To work with groups an instance of group must be created:

    group = new Appnima.Socket.Group();

Create a group:

    group.create("name", ["2387569328yvc2","21y89ch3x8hg2032","2938tyh2g0ghh0i2bg8"]);

Get the groups I take part:

    group.list().then(function(error, groups){[code]});

Remove group:

    group.remove("id");

Change the name of the group:

    group.rename("id", "name");

Get the messages of the group. The second parameter is the page number, the first page is 0 and each page have 50 messages:

    group.messages("id", 0);

Delete unread messages count, the first parameter is the group id:

    group.deleteUnreadCount("id");

Chat
----
Chats are rooms from 1 to N users without persistence. In chats, as happens in the groups, only allowed users can connect and send data.To work with Chats first of all a instance of Chat must be created:

    chat = new Appnima.Socket.Chat();

Create a room:

    chat.create("name", ["2387569328yvc2","21y89ch3x8hg2032","2938tyh2g0ghh0i2bg8"]);


Emiter & Listener
-----------------
#### Emiter
The emiter is a room in which the autor of it is the only person allowed to send messages and the receivers must connect to it using `Appnima.Socket.Listener`. To create it the first thing is creating an instance of Emiter:

    room = new Appnima.Socket.Emiter();

Create a room:

    room.create("context");


#### Listener
The listener connects to rooms created with emiter and receives it messages. To create it the first thing is creating en instance and it will connect automatically to the room:

    listener = new Appnima.Socket.Listener("context");


Application
-----------
The application channel allows the users of an application to communicate with others. To connect to it just create an instance of the application:

    application = new Appnima.Socket.Application();


Inbox
-----
The inbox allows a user to receive messages from other users. The messages will only be received by the room author, but any user can send data.To do this create an instance of Inbox:

    inbox = new Appnima.Socket.Inbox();

Get the unread messages count by group:

    inbox.unreadCount(callback);

Get online friends:

    inbox.onOnlineFriends(callback);

Friend connection/disconnection:

    inbox.onFriendStatusChange(callback);

Send data to an user:

    inbox.sendToUser(user_id, data);


Methods
-------
This methods are the same for all the socket types seen previously:

* `instance.connect("id")`: Connect to a  Group or Chat

* `instance.disconnect()`: Disconnect from a room

* `instance.allowUSers(["","",""…])`: Add allowed users to Groups or Chats

* `instance.disallowUsers(["","",""…])`: Remove users from allewed list

* `instance.send(message)`: Send a message to all the users of a room, also the sender

* `instance.broadcast(message)`: Send a message to all the users of a room, except the sender

* `instance.onConnect(callback)`: Calls to the callback on room connection

* `instance.onError(callback)`: Calls to the callback on error

* `instance.onDisconnect(callback)`: Calls to the callback when the socket disconnect

* `instance.onMessage(callback)`: Calls to the callback on message received, the recived message will be an object like this:
    * content:  "message content"
    * user: {"Information about the sender"}
    * created_at: "2013-11-16T05:55:02.736Z"

Payments
========
Appnimajs provides a easy purchase and payments methods, you only have to follow this rules to make any purchase or payment.


Purchases
---------
Purchases without money exchange requirements should be done through purchase option. The purchases of appnima are made in a two step procedure. The way to generate a correct purchase you must follow this sequence. Generation of a purchase and confirmation of it.

### Create a purchase
To acomplish a purchase that has no money exchange needs first you have to call Appnima.js purchase method. The purchases follow a 2 step secuence,purchase generation and purchase confirmation. First step is purchase generation:

	Appnima.Payments.purchase({reference: "Purchase reference"});
	
If everything goes right appnima returns us a single use token to confirm our purchase later.

	{
		token: "purchase_secret_token",
		amount: 0
	
	}

### Confirm a purchase

To confirm a purchase you mus send back the purchase token that appnima returned us in the previous step. Remember you also have to send the amount in this case 0.


	Appnima.Payments.purchase({token: "purchase_secret_token", amount: 0});
	
When you confirm the purchase to appnima it will return the main information of the purchase, with a state with value 3 that means the purchase has confirmed correctly.


	{
		reference: "Reference you want for the purchase",
		payed_at: purchase_confirmation_date,

	}

CreditCards
-----------

To make payments posible Appnima stores your CreditCards information in a secure way so you dont have to send the credit card information any time you want to purchase something. 

### Create a Credit Card
To create a new credit card you only have to send credit card info with a valid session. Calling createCreditCard will attach a new credit card to a users profile only if it is not previously created.

	Appnima.Payments.createCreditCard({number: "4242424242424242", cvc: 123, expiration_date: "11/2015"})

If the process ends correctly you mus receive this information:

	{
		id: "credit_card_ID",
		number: "xxxxxxxxxxxx4242"
	}
	
### Check a user Credit Cards
To see all the credit cards a user has attached to his account you only have to call getCreditCards method.

	Appnima.Payments.getCreditCards()
	
It will return us an array with all the credit cards information.

### Delete a Credit Card
For security reasons to delete a credit card you must do it with the ID of the credit card. Send the id through the method deleteCreditCard and the CreditCard will be erased.

	Appnima.Payments.deleteCreditCard({id: "credit_card_ID"})

If all goes right Appnima will return a code 200 Succesfull message.

### Modify a Credit Card
For same security reasons to update a credit card you must do it with the ID of the credit card. Send the id  and the parameters you want to change through the method updateCreditCard and the CreditCard information will be updated.

	Appnima.Payments.updateCreditCard({id: "credit_card_ID", number: "4343434343434343"})

Once again If all goes right Appnima will return a code 200 Succesfull message.

Payment Providers
-----------------
When we need to create a purchase that needs money exchange requirements we must do it with one of the Appnima payment providers.

### Stripe

#### Buy with Stripe
To make a purchase with Stripe we only have to send 3 things, a reference for the purchase, the id of the credit card in wich you want to generate the charge and the amount you want to charge.

      Appnima.Payments.stripePurchase({reference:"Purchase reference", credit_card : "credit_card_ID", amount: 10000})

If everything goes right appnima returns us a single use token to confirm our purchase later:

	 {
	 	token: "purchase_secret_token",
	 	 amount: 10000 
	 }


#### Stripe purchase confirmation
To confirm a purchase you mus send back the purchase token that appnima returned us in the previous step. Remember you also have to send the amount.

      Appnima.Payments.stripeConfirm({token: "purchase_secret_token", amount: 10000})
