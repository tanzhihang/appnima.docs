USER
====

Use this module to add users of your project within App/nima platform. To do so, all request have to go to:

    http://appnima-user.eu01.aws.af.cm/{RESOURCE}

```

```json
    {
        ...
        username:   "soyjavi",
        name:       "Javi Jimenez",
        avatar:     "http://USER_AVATAR_URL"
    }
```
