========
Find out how to add soul to your apps with first LaaS in the world.

*Current version: [1.0.0]()*

Introduction
------------
Just for reading this document you are telling that you are a developer who wants to improve his skills continously and wants to create more efficient projects. App/nima is the first platform which offers logic services for any type of project, no matter you want to create an application or a site, App/nima will help you in both situations.

A bit of history, 3 years ago in [**Tapquo**](http://tapquo.com) we found a common problem in the development area, it was sthat each new product we create we had to repeat every time the same basic functionalities. App/nima borns from the need of being more efficients and the desire to develop only the business features of our new product and no more the horizontal l

+ OAuth 2 services for authentication
+ User management
+ User social network
+ Messaging service to send emails, SMS, calls and private messages
+ Find/geolocate places
+ Find/geolocate other users
+ Real-time communications via sockets
+ Push notifications for ioS, Android and Blackberry
+ Get our users' behaviour

If sometime you have had to develop some of this functionalities in any project, you are welcome to our platform because App/nima is thougth to help you as a developer. We want to give you a platform made to ease your life, we love software as much as you and we seek being better. Use App/nima.


### Arquitecture
Probably now you have doubts of how App/nima can help you in being more efficient, but calm down we are going to explain you how it works. App/nima is completely based in the authentication protocol [**Oauth 2**](http://oauth.net/2/) and in the serialization via REST-style with JSON objects. If you have never used this paradigm don't worry, we are explaining step by step how to connect to the platform and will offer you explicit tools such as [**AppnimaJS**](http://) that will ease you the connection process.

All the backend is deployed around the world using platforms such as Amazon or Google Cloud Engine, the ones which give us the ability to give allways the best response quality for our users. Don't worry, you won't have to be a *Jedy SysAdmin* because you will only have to communicate with our REST. The scalability is our duty, you will only have to worry about creating the best project and us in providing every day the best platform.

In summary, App/nima is a platform in a REST API way that provide you with the logical services of your projects, and depending the nature of your project maybe you won't need your own backend. Each logical service is hosted in different servers to obtain the biggest independent scalability, along the documentation we will watch the routes of each service.

### OAuth 2
All App/nima services use the authentication protocol [**OAuth 2**](http://oauth.net/2/) looking for the largest compatibility with third party tools. If you are not an expert in Oauth 2 we recommend you to study it, because it is beeing the authentication protocol by default and companies like Google, Facebook or Twitter use it to connect with their APIs. Read the [documentation](http://) to start right now working with App/nima.

### No XML, just JSON
We only allow JSON type data serialization. Our format is not to have any root element and use *snake_case* to describe atributes' keys. This means that each petition to App/nimamust be send the sufix:

    Content-Type: application / json; charset = utf-8

Yo will receive a response 415 *Unsupported Media Type* if you try to use another URL sufix.


### Use HTTP cache
You have to use the *freshness* HTTP headers to reduce our servers' load (and speed up your application!). Most of the petitions we return will include an *ETag* or a header *Last-Modified*. The first time you request a resource, store this value and send it to us in the next petitions as *If-None-Match* and *If-Modified-Since*. If the resource hasn't change you will obtain the code 304 *Not Modified* as response, saving time and broadband (because you already have the resource)


### Handling errors
If App/nima has any problem, it is possible that you get an 5xx error. 500 means that the application is totally down, but you can also get a 502 *Bad Gateway*, 503 *Service Unavailable*, or 504 *Gateway Timeout*. In all these situations it is your responsibility to try again later.

API REST
========
Authentication
--------------
With this resource App/nima get user token through the OAuth system called 2-step. The resource path is:

    http://appnima.com/{RESOURCE}

The following explains how to get token using this method.


#### Step 1: GET /oauth/authorize
User will be redirected to another URL. This resource is called with the following parameters:
``` json
response_type   : type of request. Should be `code`.
client_id       : your public ID application.
scope           : token permissions
redirect_uri    : URL to redirect. It will be the same as you provide when you registered your application.
state           : state parameter with response to identify the operation.
```

The URL will be like this:

    http://api.appnima.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=profile,push&response_type=code&client_id=519b84f0c1881dc1b3000002&redirect_uri=http://myapp.com&state=user48

The user will see a site where will be shown data application and permissions required. If rejected or something it is wrong with query, user will be redirect to site specifying the error.

If the request was successful, user will be redirect to a site with a field `code` that allows to follow the process.


#### Step 2: POST /oauth2/token
After get `code`, token will be request. To do so, this resource will be called with "http basic authorization"  header with your appnima key and the parameters:
```header
	{ 
		Authorization: "basic APPNIMA-KEY" 
	}
```


```json
    {
        grant_type: "code",
        code:       "h02h40g208ghop2envg2h9h2epne2eh092he0b2",
        client_id:  "532023h2308h2839h"
    }
```

If the query was successful returns `201 Created` and the object:
```json
    {
        token_type:      "bearer",
        refresh_token:   "n72c03ty202ugx2gu2u",
        access_token:    "eh024hg02g2onvev29"
    }
```

#### Refreshing Token: POST /oauth2/token
When you try to access to a server's resource but it returns an error code `480` indicates that the token is expired, to refresh the `access_token` and `refresh_token` values use this resource using the "http authorization basic" header with your appnima key and the parameters:
```header
	{ 
		Authorization: "basic APPNIMA-KEY" 
	}
```

```json
    {
    	grant_type:          "refresh_token",
        refresh_token:       "n72c03ty202ugx2gu2u"
    }
```

Response returns the following object:

```json
    {
        access_token: 		'cd776kk02g2ata629`',
  		expires_in: 		'2013-08-06T06:58:37.298Z',
  		refresh_token: 		'kuo54jk02g9lmoovp9',
	  	scope: 				[ 'profile' ]
    }
```

Socket
------
App/nima provides sockets environments to get chat rooms. To do so, all request have to go to:

    http://socket.appnima.com/{RESOURCE}

Remember all requests to App/nima should be identified by your `Appnima.key` or key pair `client` and `secret`.

So, the first parameter is the type of request (GET, POST, UPDATE, DELETE â€¦) and the second the name of resource.


### Getting started
To do real time communication, appnima connects to the rooms that have been created using socket.io. Now you will see the methods that are exposed to interact with them. Although we recommend using our library `Appnima.js` for this purpose.

#### open
To create a room we will call to the `open` method. This one will receive the following parameters:

* User's token
* Context (it will be used to identify the room for future connections)
* Room name
* Room Type
* If we want that the room persist in time
* Allowed users' id array

If everythng is right the room will be created and the author will be automatically connected to it.

#### join
A user can be connected to a room if it is created and he has permission to connect to it. To do this `join` method must be called with the following parameters:

* User's token (for anonymous session not required)
* Context (identification of the room to connect)
* Application id (in case of anonymous session it is mandatory)

#### leave
To disconnect from a room just call the method `leave`.

#### sendmessage
To send a message to a room just call the method `sendMessage` with an object as parameter (a message can be any type of data). This message will be received by all the room's users, also the sender, through a listener called `onMessage` and it will have the following format:
```json
    {
        user:           {"user that sends the message"},
        message:        {"message sent"},
        created_at:     "2013-05-23T12:01:02.736Z"
    }
```

#### sendbroadcast
This methods works as `sendMessage`, the unique difference is that the sender won't receive the message.

#### allowusers
Users can be added to the allowed user list using `allowUsers` method, to do this just call this method and use users' id array as parameter.

#### disallowusers
Users can be removed from the allowed user list using `disallowUsers` method, to do this just call this method and use users' id array as parameter.


### Types and permissions
There are several room types, each one has different permissions depending the user.

* Private: Only users in the allowed list can connect, send and receive messages in this room.
* Public: All the people can connect to this room, but only the owner can post.
* Inbox: Only the owner can read messages, but any user can send messages.
* Application: This room exists in all the applications so no one can create it, everyone can connect, receive or send messages in it.
